# Model-Evaluation
This repository contains information and material for the Model Evaluation, a personal project. The purpose of the project is to have a compact a source file, which you may use when you want to evaluate the efficiency of a machine learning model. The project was written in Python. It's a source files, which includes four classes, ClassificationModelEvaluation, RegressionModelEvaluation, ClusteringModelEvaluation and EvaluationDiagrams. The first three classes are equipped with a great deal of task-specific error metrics, along with probability calibration metrics, with a variety of task-specific cross validation approches, and with probability calibration. The last class is equipped with a variety of diagrams to visualize all the prementioned tasks.
